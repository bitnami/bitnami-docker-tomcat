# What is Tomcat?

> [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org), often referred to as Tomcat, is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the [Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](https://www.apache.org). Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in.

# TLDR

```bash
docker run --name tomcat bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
tomcat:
  image: bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Tomcat Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/tomcat).

```bash
docker pull bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/tomcat/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
docker pull bitnami/tomcat:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t bitnami/tomcat:latest https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-tomcat.git
```

# Persisting your Tomcat configurations and deployments

If you remove the container all your Tomcat configurations and deployments will be lost. To avoid this you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

**Note!**
If you have already started using your Tomcat deployment, follow the steps on
[backing up](#backing-up-your-container) and [restoring](#restoring-a-backup) to pull the data from your running container down to your host.

The image exposes a volume at `/bitnami/tomcat` for the Tomcat configurations and application deployments. For persistence you can mount a directory at this location from your host. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run.

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/tomcat-persistence:/bitnami/tomcat bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
tomcat:
  image: bitnami/tomcat:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/tomcat-persistence:/bitnami/tomcat
```

# Deploying web applications on Tomcat

The `/bitnami/tomcat/data` directory is configured as the Tomcat webapps deployment directory. At this location, you either copy a so-called *exploded web application*, i.e. non-compressed, or a compressed web application resource (`.WAR`) file and it will automatically be deployed by Tomcat.

Additionally a helper symlink `/app` is present that points to the webapps deployment directory which enables us to deploy applications on a running Tomcat instance by simply doing:

```bash
docker cp /path/to/app.war tomcat:/app
```

**Note!**
You can also deploy web applications on a running Tomcat instance using the Tomcat management interface.

# Accessing your Tomcat server from the host

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to port `8080` exposed in the container.

```bash
docker run --name tomcat -P bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random ports Docker assigned.

```bash
$ docker port tomcat
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32768
```

You can also manually specify the ports you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

# Configuration

## Creating a custom user

By default, a management user named `user` is created and is not assigned a password. Passing the `TOMCAT_PASSWORD` environment variable when running the image for the first time will set the password of this user to the value of `TOMCAT_PASSWORD`.

Additionally you can specify a user name for the management user using the `TOMCAT_USER` environment variable. When not specified, the `TOMCAT_PASSWORD` configuration is applied on the default user (`user`).

```bash
docker run --name tomcat \
  -e TOMCAT_USER=my_user \
  -e TOMCAT_PASSWORD=my_password \
  bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
tomcat:
  image: bitnami/tomcat:latest
  environment:
    - TOMCAT_USER=my_user
    - TOMCAT_PASSWORD=my_password
```

## Configuration files

This image looks for Tomcat configuration files in `/bitnami/tomcat/conf`. You may recall from the [persisting your tomcat configurations and deployments](#persisting-your-tomcat-configurations-and-deployments) section, `/bitnami/tomcat` is the path to the persistence volume.

Create a directory named `conf/` at this location with your own configuration, or the default configuration will be copied on the first run which can be customized later.

### Step 1: Run the Tomcat image

Run the Tomcat image, mounting a directory from your host.

```bash
docker run --name tomcat -v /path/to/tomcat-persistence:/bitnami/tomcat bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
tomcat:
  image: bitnami/tomcat:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/tomcat-persistence:/bitnami/tomcat
```

### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

eg.

```bash
vim /path/to/tomcat-persistence/conf/server.xml
```

### Step 3: Restart Tomcat

After changing the configuration, restart your Tomcat container for the changes to take effect.

```bash
docker restart tomcat
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose restart tomcat
```

# Logging

The Bitnami Tomcat Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```bash
docker logs tomcat
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose logs tomcat
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Maintenance

## Backing up your container

To backup your configuration and logs, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Stop the currently running container

```bash
docker stop tomcat
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose stop tomcat
```

### Step 2: Run the backup command

We need to mount two volumes in a container we will use to create the backup: a directory on your host to store the backup in, and the volumes from the container we just stopped so we can access the data.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/tomcat-backups:/backups --volumes-from tomcat busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/tomcat /backups/latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/tomcat-backups:/backups --volumes-from `docker-compose ps -q tomcat` busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/tomcat /backups/latest
```

## Restoring a backup

Restoring a backup is as simple as mounting the backup as volumes in the container.

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/tomcat-backups/latest:/bitnami/tomcat bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
tomcat:
  image: bitnami/tomcat:latest
  volumes:
    - /path/to/tomcat-backups/latest:/bitnami/tomcat
```

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Tomcat, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
docker pull bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to
`bitnami/tomcat:latest`.

### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Before continuing, you should backup your container's configuration and logs.

Follow the steps on [creating a backup](#backing-up-your-container).

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```bash
docker rm -v tomcat
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose rm -v tomcat
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image, [restoring your backup](#restoring-a-backup) if necessary.

```bash
docker run --name tomcat bitnami/tomcat:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose start tomcat
```

# Testing

This image is tested for expected runtime behavior, using the [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) testing framework. You can run the tests on your machine using the `bats` command.

```
bats test.sh
```

# Notable Changes

## 8.0.35-r0

- All volumes have been merged at `/bitnami/tomcat`. Now you only need to mount a single volume at `/bitnami/tomcat` for persistence.
- The logs are always sent to the `stdout` and are no longer collected in the volume.
